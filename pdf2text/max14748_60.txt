NAME - - - - CHGINILimGate SDPMaxCur[1:0] CDPMaxCur
CHGINILimGateCHGINILim Control options  
0 = No gating of CHGINILim setting by BC1.2 FSM  
1 = Gate changes in CHGINILim until BC1.2 FSM completes – ChgTypRun = 0
SDPMaxCur[1:0]SDP Nonstandard Type-C Cable Control.  USB-C to USB-A cables may have incorrect CC resistor 
indicating 1.5A or 3A. Requires CHGINILimGate = 1.  
00 = No modification of CHGIN_LIM  
01 = Limit SDP to 500mA. ChgTyp = 01 (SDP) and PrChgTyp = 000 (unknown) set CHGINILim[6:0] to 0x0F  
10 = Limit SDP to 1.0A. ChgTyp = 01 (SDP) and PrChgTyp = 000 (unknown) set CHGINILim[6:0] to 0x1E  
11 = Limit SDP to 1.5A. ChgTyp = 01 (SDP) and PrChgTyp = 000 (unknown) set CHGINILim[6:0] to 0x2D
CDPMaxCurCDP Nonstandard Type-C cable control.  USB-C to USB-A cables may have incorrect CC resistor indicating 
3A. Requires CHGIN_LIM_Gate = 1.  
0 = No modification of CHGIN_LIM  
1 = Limit CDP to 1.5A. ChgTyp = 10 (CDP) and PrChgTyp = 000 (unknown) set CHGINILim[6:0] to 0x2D

NAME AICLEn - - - - - - AICLAbort
AICLEnAICL Enable. Writing 1 to AICLEn enables AICL operation. Note that if AICLAbort is 1, AICL operation is not 
allowed. This bit auto-resets to 0.  
0 = No Action  
1 = AICL enabled
AICLAbortHigh Priority AICL Abort. 
0 = Device is allowed to run AICL by writing 1 to AICLEn. 
1 = Device is NOT allowed to run AICL operation. AICL operation will be aborted if it’s already running.
