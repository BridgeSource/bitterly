NAME DCD2s SfOutLvl - ADC3PDet SfOutCtrl[1:0] ChgDetMan ChgDetEn
DCD2sDCD2s sets the timing of DCD in BC1.2  
0 = standard  
1 = 2s
SfOutLvlSFOUT Voltage Level Select  
0 = 5V  
1 = 3.3V
ADC3PDet3A DCP Detection Enable (adds detection step after BC1.2 completes to detect presence of 3A DCP)  
0 = Not Enabled  
1 = Enabled
SfOutCtrl[1:0]Safe Out LDO SFOUT Control  
00 = Always Disabled  
01 = On if a valid CHGIN voltage is present  
10 =Turns on under following conditions. 
        a. ChgDetEn = 1, CHGIN is valid, and BC1.2 FSM Detection is finished
        b. ChgDetEn = 0, and CHGIN is valid  
11: RFU
 
Note:  CHGIN valid can be external CHGIN voltage or CHGIN voltage generated by reverse buck in Attached.
SRC_CCx mode. A system that supports power swap must not use SFOUT LDO to supply USB transceiver. 
According to USB PD specification, CHGIN will collapse during power swap. This turns off SFOUT LDO which is 
supplied from CHGIN, and kills USB communication.
ChgDetManChgDetMan forces manual run of charger detection. (Bit auto-resets to 0)  
0 = Not enabled  
1 = Request manual run of charger detection
ChgDetEnCharger Detection Enable  
0 = Not enabled  
1 = Enabled (charger detection runs every time V CHGIN  > VBDET  and DetAbrt = 0)
