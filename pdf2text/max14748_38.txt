NAME DirChgFault - LowPow - ChgStat[3:0]
DirChgFaultDirect charging fault  
0 = Device in normal operation  
1 = V BAT drops below V PCHG  when battery is in supplement mode.
LowPowLow Power Mode
0 = Not In Low Power Mode
1 = In Low Power Mode
ChgStat[3:0]Status of Charger Mode 
0000 = Charger off 
0001 = Charging suspended due to temperature (see state diagram) 
0010 = Pre-charge in progress 
0011 = Fast-charge, constant current mode in progress
0100 = Fast-charge, constant voltage mode in progress
0101 = Maintain charge in progress 
0110 = Maintain charge done 
0111 = Charger fault condition (see state diagram)
1000 = Battery Fault Suspend (see state diagram)

ChgThrmStat[2:0]Thermistor Monitor  
000 = T < T1  
001 = T1 < T < T2  
010 = T2 < T < T3  
011 = T3 < T < T4  
100 = T > T4  
101 = No thermistor detected (THM high due to external pullup).  Note: If a parallel resistor is used for 
thermistor monitoring, this mode may not function properly.  
110 = NTC input disabled through ThermEn.  
111 = Detection disabled due to CHGIN not present.
