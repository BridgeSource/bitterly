NAME - - - - VSAFE0V DetAbrt - -
VSAFE0VStatus of VBUS Detection. (Valid only in Attached.SRC_CCx, Attached.SNK_CCx state)
0 = V CHGIN  < VSAFE0V  
1 = V CHGIN  > VSAFE0V
DetAbrtCharger Detection Abort
0 = Charger Detection runs if ChgDetEn = 1 and VBUS is valid for the debounce time  
1 = Charger Detection is aborted by Type-C State Machine. Charger detection will run if ChgDetEn = 1 and 
VBUS is valid for the debounce time. ChgDetMan bit allows manual run of charger detection. If Charger 
Detection is in progress, DetAbrt = 1 immediately stops the in-progress detection.
